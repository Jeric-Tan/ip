# A-MorOOP + A-Packages
Used Copilot and more specifically GPT-4.1 to help refactor and seperate out the code into individual files to better 'OOP'. Oberservations was that the model was pretty good at seperating the files within the same folder with multiple prompting, however was abit poor when it came to putting them into different folders (although could have just been bad prompting on my end).
